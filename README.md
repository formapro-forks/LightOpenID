**[DEPRECATED] Official library was added to packagist: lightopenid\lightopenid. Use it!**

This is mirror of official https://gitorious.org/lightopenid/lightopenid repo with added composer support.
I use it with FpOpenIdBundle to easy setup it.

Will switch to official repo as soon as PR https://gitorious.org/lightopenid/lightopenid/merge_requests/17 would merge.
